**Causes and Risk Factors**

The development of Rangii toenail fungus, like other fungal infections, thrives in warm, damp environments. Common causes and risk factors include:

**Poor Foot Hygiene:** Inadequate cleaning and drying of the feet can create an ideal environment for fungi to grow.

**Tight or Non-Breathable Footwear:** Wearing shoes that trap moisture can encourage fungal growth.

**Walking Barefoot in Public Places:** Fungi can spread in places like locker rooms, swimming pools, and communal showers.

**Weakened Immune System:** People with compromised immune systems are more susceptible to fungal infections.

**Previous Fungal Infections:** Having experienced toenail fungus before increases the risk of recurrence.

**Symptoms**

Identifying Rangii toenail fungus requires recognizing its distinct symptoms, which often manifest as:

Thickened Nails: The infected nails may become thicker than usual.

Discoloration: The nails might turn yellow, brown, or even greenish in color.

Brittle Texture: Infected nails tend to become brittle and crumbly.

Change in Shape: The nails may change shape, becoming distorted or misshapen.

Foul Odor: A strong, unpleasant odor may emanate from the infected nails.

Pain or Discomfort: In some cases, the infection can cause pain or discomfort, especially if left untreated.

**Diagnosis**

Diagnosing Rangii toenail fungus involves a combination of physical examination and laboratory tests. A healthcare professional will inspect the affected nails and might take a nail clipping for analysis. Microscopic examination and fungal culture can help confirm the presence of the Rangii fungus and rule out other potential causes.

**Treatment Options**

Effective management of Rangii toenail fungus typically requires a multi-faceted approach. Some treatment options include:

**Topical Antifungals:** Over-the-counter or prescription antifungal creams, lotions, or nail paints can be applied directly to the infected nails.

**Oral Antifungals:** In severe cases, doctors may prescribe oral antifungal medications that target the fungal infection from within.

**Laser Therapy:** Certain laser treatments can help eliminate the fungus without damaging the surrounding tissue.

**Surgical Intervention:** In extreme cases where the infection is causing significant pain or discomfort, partial or complete nail removal might be considered.

**Lifestyle Changes:** Practicing good foot hygiene, wearing breathable shoes, and avoiding walking barefoot in public areas can help prevent and manage fungal infections.

**Pelargonium Graveolens Oil**

A **[study](https://www.glitco.com/get-rangii)** published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology in 2017 investigated the antimicrobial activity of various essential oils, including Pelargonium Graveolens Oil, against a common skin pathogen called Staphylococcus aureus.

The researchers found that Pelargonium Graveolens Oil exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against this bacterium, inhibiting its growth and reducing its ability to cause skin infections.

**Horsetail**

Silica in horsetail acts as a building block for collagen, aiding in the formation of strong and flexible connective tissues. It helps to strengthen the extracellular matrix, which is the framework that supports our skin and nails. By enhancing collagen production and improving the integrity of the extracellular matrix, horsetail can contribute to healthier, more resilient skin and nails.

**Lemon Extract**

Lemon extract, derived from the peel of lemons, is rich in bioactive compounds such as citric acid, vitamin C, flavonoids, and essential oils. These compounds possess antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, which make lemon extract an excellent choice for maintaining healthy skin and combating fungal infections.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Hyaluronic Acid**

Hyaluronic acid acts as a key regulator in the synthesis and degradation of collagen. It stimulates fibroblast cells present in the dermis to produce collagen fibers. Fibroblasts are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix components, including collagen. By promoting collagen synthesis, hyaluronic acid helps to maintain the structural integrity and elasticity of the skin and nails.

**Potassium Sorbate**

Potassium sorbate is known for its antifungal properties. Nail fungus, also known as onychomycosis, is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide.

The results showed that potassium sorbate exhibited strong antifungal properties, inhibiting the growth of both dermatophytes and yeasts.

**Aloe Barbadensis**

Aloe barbadensis or aloe vera is a perennial plant that typically grows in a rosette form. It has thick, fleshy leaves that are green in color and can reach a length of up to 24 inches.

The primary working principle behind aloe vera's ability to boost collagen production lies in its rich composition of bioactive compounds.
